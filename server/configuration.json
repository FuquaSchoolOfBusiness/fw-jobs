In the case that you are unable to serve to the end of the designated timeframe, we ask that you give the Sponsor a minimum of 2-weeks notice and, if possible, train a replacement FVC Member.<\/p><p class=\"style-scope fw-jobs\">Graduates on an F1 visa must have their EAD card prior to starting an OPT-qualified volunteer opportunity.<br class=\"style-scope fw-jobs\"><br class=\"style-scope fw-jobs\">Navigation Notes:<\/p><ol><li class=\"style-scope fw-jobs\"><em class=\"style-scope fw-jobs\">Priority Due<\/em> indicates the date on which priority applications submitted by international students facing visa constraints will be reviewed and submitted to the Sponsor.
