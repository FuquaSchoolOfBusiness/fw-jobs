configuration.json 
=========================

This document represents the configuration file pulled back from the server for the application.
It stores configuration data for the instance of the application.  This implementation currently 
only support a single configuration, but it would be quite simple to allow for multiple configurations
such as in a multi-tenet scenario.

Items in this document:

"skills" is an array of strings representing possible skills to assign to a job posting.  It is 
managed in the application administrative interface.

"list_intro" is the rich text (HTML) for the introduction to the job posting page shown to the job 
seekers.  It is managed in the application administrative interface.

"programs" is an array of string representing possible program alignments to assign to a job posting.
It is managed in the application administrative interface.

"field_selectors" is an array of field names that can be hidden in the job seeker interface.  This list 
is NOT managed in the application administrative interface but the data MUST appear in this document 
or it will affect those options.  Removing the values will eliminate that field from being an option and 
emptying the array will eliminate the entire option form showing.

"admins" is an array of strings that are user identifiers matching administrators of the application.
This list is NOT managed in the application administrative interface but the data MUST appear in this
document or it will affect the application (the array can be empty).   The administrative interface 
will only show for users with an identity that is listed.

"_rev" is a CouchDB field representing the version of the document.  It is system generated, and
does not need to be present if the document is being generated from another system.  It is not used 
directly by the application.

"_id" is a CouchDB field representing the identity of the document.  It is system generated, and
does not need to be present if the document is being generated from another system.  It is not used 
directly by the application.



jobs.json
==========================

All of the fields are managed in the administrative interface except the "_id", "_rev", and "uuid" 
fields.

"_rev" is a CouchDB field representing the version of the document.  It is system generated, and
does not need to be present if the document is being generated from another system.  It is not used 
directly by the application.

"_id" is a CouchDB field representing the identity of the document.  It is system generated, and
does not need to be present if the document is being generated from another system.  It is not used 
directly by the application.

"uuid" is a string that is added to each job posting on the server side to provide a unique
identity for each job posting independent of the storage system.  This is managed completely on the
save endpoint for job postings and frankly is unnecessary.  It is not used directly by the application
and was done in the case that an identity for the job posting was necessary for state management.  In
the front-end this is not necessary but it might be necessary in a back-end that does not automatically
assign identity.  The added and required "id" field replaced the need for the "uuid".

"overview" is a string field that represent a very brief overview of the job posting and does not 
support rich text.

"visible" is a boolean field indicating if job seekers can see this job posting.

"apply" is a rich text (HTML) field for instructions on how to apply for the job posting.

"latest_start" is an optional string date field representing the latest date a job applicant would be
expected to begin work.  It has a format of "2020-06-15".

"earliest_start" is an optional string date field representing the earliest date a job applicant would
be able to begin work.  It has a format of "2020-06-15".
    
"url" is an optional URL for the company offering the job posting.

"priority_due" is an optional string date field indicating the preference for applications received by
the specified date.  It has a format of "2020-05-25".
    
"duration" is an optional string field representing the number of weeks the position is expected
to run.

"skills" is an array of strings representing the required skills for the position (this options for
this list are managed in the configuration of the application).

"organization" is the name of the company offering the job posting.

"modified" is a string date field indicating the last time the job posting was updated.  It is an 
ISO-8601 format as follows: "2020-05-19T19:43:10.006Z".

"details" is a rich text (HTML) field describing the job and other details associated.

"id" is a required string arbitrarily defining an id for the job posting.  In the application it is 
expected to be a single alphabetical character followed by a number, e.g. "F25"

"programs" is an array of string representing the appropriate degree programs related to the
job posting.
